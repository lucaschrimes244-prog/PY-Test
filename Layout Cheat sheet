#columnLayout
#Stacks children vertically.
#Expands vertically, but not horizontally by default.
#When inside a scrollLayout, it remembers its smallest width — can cause “squished” tables.

#rowLayout
#Places children horizontally.
#You must manually specify widths or use adjustableColumn.
#If widths are not set, controls overlap or compress.

#formLayout
#The most flexible layout — lets you “attach” children to each edge or to other controls.
#Always fills parent, automatically resizes.
#Slightly more verbose, but rock-solid for dynamic UIs.

#frameLayout
#Collapsible frame with title bar.
#Resizes contents based on collapse state.
#Nested frameLayouts can mess up spacing.

#scrollLayout
#Adds scrollbars around a single child layout.
#Does not resize child automatically unless childResizable=True.
#If created empty, may “lock in” a tiny child width.

#tabLayout
#Tabs between child layouts.
#Each child layout behaves independently.
#Each tab can have independent width problems.
